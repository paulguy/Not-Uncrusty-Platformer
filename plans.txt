weirdcore, vaporwave, "early 3D graphics"
neon/cyberpunky city
road with dusky sky, yellow/orange/red/purple/blue palette, open field,
   distant buildings
Weird dream where everything was like, yellow/orange/red "rays" of light or
    whatever.

Overworld Level:
left beach (vaporwavey)
city
    transitioning from neon/vaporwave to cyberpunk to liminal spaces, getting
    progressively aged to being kinda rundown and "duke3d like"
    maybe some buildings going deep down to transition to some underground
    areas.
road
    just a kinda peaceful transition area. :)
    gas station?
mountains with snow
    maybe some caves that can go down in to some underground regions.
green, grassy, trees, generally "normal" outdoors area, where the player would
    out from at the start
another beach, but "normal"
